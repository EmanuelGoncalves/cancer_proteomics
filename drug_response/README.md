Figure 4

1. Multi-omic comparison of predictive power on drug response
   1. Methylation show adequate predictive power already
   2. predictive results are similar across Methylation~Transcriptome~Proteome
2. Deep learning outperforms traditional models
3. Consistency between RNA and protein predictions
   1. Motesanib is particularly well predicted by proteome
4. Comparison against CCLE data
5. Top pan-drug and drug specific proteins (LMNA and ERBB2)
6. GO and pathway enriched for additionally informative proteins (AIPs)



Figure 4S

1. Cell line number cut-off
2. Detailed comparison between RNA and protein data
   1. No meaningful difference across ENet, RF and DL
3. Performance on FDA approved drugs
4. Model stability comparision
5. LMNA is shown as a pan-drug marker in linear models + MOFA analysis
6. VTN as the most important AIP is confirmed in linear models
7. String network of AIPs
